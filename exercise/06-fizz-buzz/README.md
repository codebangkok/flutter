## Exercise: fizz buzz

Write a program that implements the "fizz buzz" algorithm, defined as follows:

```
for i from 1 to 15
    if i is divisible by 3 and 5
        print "fizz buzz"
    otherwise if i is divisible by 3
        print "fizz"
    otherwise if i is divisible by 5
        print "buzz"
    otherwise
        print i
```

Hint: you'll need to use the integer modulo operator (`%`) and the logical AND operator (`&&`).
