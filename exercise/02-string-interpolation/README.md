## Exercise: String interpolation

Given the following variables:

```dart
double temperature = 20;
int value = 2;
String pizza = 'pizza';
String pasta = 'pasta';
```

Write a program that produces this output by using all of them:

```
The temperature is 20C
2 plus 2 makes 4
I like pizza and pasta
```

The output should update correctly if we change the values of the variables.

For example, if value is 3, the program should print:

```
3 plus 3 makes 6
```
