## Exercise: if/else statements

Define two integer variables called `netSalary` and `expenses`.

Then write a program that prints different sentences depending on these conditions:

```
if netSalary > expenses
    You have saved $(netSalary - expenses) this month
otherwise if expenses > netSalary
    You have lost $(expenses - netSalary) this month
otherwise
    Your balance hasn't changed
```

Then verify that the program works correctly for different values of `netSalary` and `expenses`.
