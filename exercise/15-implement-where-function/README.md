## Exercise: Implement the `where` function

Implement a `where` function that takes two arguments:

- A list of items
- A function argument that can be used to filter items in the list by evaluating each item with a boolean condition

This function should return a new list, which contains the items filtered using the function argument.

Use generics, so the `where` function can work on lists of any type.

Then, use this function to retrieve all the odd numbers from this list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and print the result.
