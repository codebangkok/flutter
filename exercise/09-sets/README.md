## Exercise: Sets

Given two integer sets `a` and `b`, write a program to calculate the set of the elements that belong to either `a` or `b`, but not both.

For example, given the following:

```dart
const a = { 1, 3 };
const b = { 3, 5 };
```

The program should print `{1, 5}`.

Then, calculate and print the sum of all the items in the resulting set.
