## Exercise: Implement the `firstWhere` function

Implement a `firstWhere` function that takes three arguments:

- A list of items
- A function argument that can be used to find an item in the list by evaluating each item with a boolean condition
- A named function argument `orElse` that is used to return a given value if none of the items in the list matches the search condition

This function should return the first item that matches the search condition, or the value returned by the `orElse` function if no matches are found.

Use generics, so the `firstWhere` function can work on lists of any type.

Then, use this function to find the value `5` from this list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The function should return `-1` in this case.
